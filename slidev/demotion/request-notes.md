**Before Applifting**

Several years of experience in PHP and later Node, worked in Homodevelopus, Video Recruitment Solutions, Lusk - mostly online recruitment solutions, where I in the end became the main BE dev before the company was sold.

## **Client Projects Experience**

**GoodData**

Minor contributions to existing trial-provisioning tooling.

**DX Tracker (2019)**

Worked on the original DX Heroes developer-experience tracking app; proposed and implemented incremental improvements.

**Politinn (2019)**

Led the design and delivery of a new backend solution for an overgrown, hard-to-maintain application.

**Digitoo (2019–2021)**

Tech-leading a mid-sized team for ~2 years. Responsible for running Scrum ceremonies, supporting hiring, and setting up deployment pipelines. Initially focused on integrating multiple third-party providers; later evolved the system into a fully-featured standalone product. Strong client satisfaction.

**Refsite (2021)**

Reference platform for photovoltaic installations (https://refsite.info/). Main backend developer, mentoring and supporting multiple junior engineers.

**Sakurabook (2022)**

Japanese Shopify plugin enabling localized purchase of short-term rentals and in-person services.

**Investbay (2023)**

Designed a pragmatic workaround for enabling Google Sign-In in a SaaS backend that did not support it natively. Leveraged internal backend templates and creative architectural compromises to deliver an acceptable, production-ready solution.

**Remangu (2023–present)**

Leading development from greenfield to a fully-featured production system in a fast-moving team (up to 5 developers). Later transitioned into a largely AI-assisted full-stack engineering model driven primarily by me.

- Delivered a large cloud-desktop platform for game studios to a presentable state in just 2 months for GDC 2023.
- Delivered a significantly more advanced playtesting-platform demo for GDC 2025 even faster, with most features designed and implemented by me.
- Collaborated on early access to then-unreleased AWS technology; the solution was later presented at GDC 2025 through an AWS × Revolgy partnership.

**Deliciously Ella (2025–present)**

Primarily analytical and architectural role with limited FTE on a complex legacy system spanning multiple providers and loosely coupled services. Proposed refactoring strategies and technical-debt reduction plans. Resulted in a clear technical roadmap with defined milestones that the team is now actively executing.

## **Representing Applifting**

### **University of Economics in Prague**

- Co-teaching the Web Project Development course (backend focus).
- Proposed and implemented a major revamp of the backend tech stack, based on a simplified version of Applifting’s internal templates.
- Updated practical classes to better teach backend best practices across varying student skill levels.
- Created a new practical class focused on AI-driven development.
- Participated in two course runs:
  - First run: teaching support and incremental improvements.
  - Second run: full tech-stack revamp based on lessons learned.
- Currently transitioning from active teaching to a technical-support role for the solution.

### **Crew Talks**

- Talk on Prisma 2 shortly after release, including a practical live example.
- Talk on Cursor and agentic development before mainstream adoption, demonstrating rapid creation of a complete web game without writing code manually.

## **Other Skillsets**

**VR / Unity / C#**

Solo development and release of a commercial VR title (https://www.bladeimpactvr.com/). Handled the full lifecycle independently: learning, development, release, and marketing. Generated several thousand USD in revenue to date.
